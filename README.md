# Ping Identity Agent Skills

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

A skill package that teaches AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot CLI, Gemini CLI) how to reason about the Ping Identity platform — which product to use, how to configure it, and how to integrate it into an application.

Skills provide **judgment and context** that MCP tools lack. MCP tools handle execution; skills handle the *what* and *why* before execution begins.

## Install

| Agent | Command |
|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `/plugin add pingidentity/agent-plugins` |
| **Cursor** | Settings → Rules → Add Rule → Remote Rule → `https://github.com/pingidentity/agent-plugins` |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Agent Skills discovery via `.well-known/agent-skills/index.json` (see [Copilot docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot)) |
| **Gemini CLI** | Add to `GEMINI.md`: `plugins: [https://github.com/pingidentity/agent-plugins]` |
| **OpenCode / other** | `npx github:pingidentity/agent-plugins validate` (validator); skill install per agent's plugin spec |

Agent discovery index: [`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pingidentity/agent-plugins/main/.well-known/agent-skills/index.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pingidentity/agent-plugins/main/.well-known/agent-skills/index.json)

## The 6 umbrella skills

| Skill | What it does | Trigger when... |
|---|---|---|
| `ping-quickstart` | Front door — detects platform and routes | Platform unknown, "where do I start", migrating from ForgeRock/Okta |
| `ping-foundation` | Tenant setup, app registration, directories, policy, branding | Configuring or administering a Ping platform |
| `ping-orchestration` | DaVinci flows, AIC/PingAM journeys, scripted nodes | Designing or building an authentication flow |
| `ping-universal-services` | Protect, Verify, Credentials, IGA, Authorize, MFA — service config and invocation | Adding a shared service to a flow (risk, KYC, credentials, governance, MFA) |
| `ping-app-integration` | Android, iOS, React, OIDC, on-prem SDK integration | Wiring Ping into app code; troubleshooting redirect/CORS/token errors |
| `ping-identity-for-ai` | AI agent identity, Verified Trust, helpdesk AI delegation | Securing an AI agent or LLM-fronted app with Ping |

Skills compose — a complete solution typically spans 2–3 skills. `ping-quickstart` tells you which combination to load.

## How it works

Every skill follows a 3-tier progressive disclosure model:

```
Tier 1 — Metadata (~100 tokens)
  skill name + description — loaded at discovery for all skills

Tier 2 — SKILL.md (<5k tokens)
  Routing decision tree: intent → platform → reference tier
  Loaded in full when the skill activates

Tier 3 — References (on demand)
  curated/    hand-authored canonical anchors (1–3 loaded per task)
  generated/  bounded top-N shortlists per platform branch
  runtime/    pointers for live Docs MCP retrieval
```

The agent stops at the first tier that answers the question. It never loads all anchors at once.

## Eval status

<!-- BEGIN: layer1-eval-table -->
<!-- END: layer1-eval-table -->

<!-- BEGIN: layer3-eval-table -->
<!-- END: layer3-eval-table -->

### What the evals show

Our internal testing consistently shows **significant token savings** when the ping-identity skills are loaded compared to a bare baseline — across all six skills and multiple model tiers. Loading a skill gives the agent the right context upfront, so it spends fewer turns exploring, self-correcting, and hallucinating Ping-specific API details.

Full eval results with per-skill and per-model breakdowns are being reviewed and will be published here once finalised.

### Run the evals yourself

```bash
pip install pyyaml jsonschema anthropic openai

# Layer 1 — routing accuracy:
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
python3 -m evals.harness.run_eval --adapter claude --layer 1

# Layer 3 — skill execution value (requires `claude` CLI on PATH):
export $(grep -v '^#' .env.local | xargs)
python3 -m evals.harness.run_layer3 --models haiku --workers 3 --max-turns 30 --timeout-s 600 --write-summary
```

## Authoring a skill or reference

Read `shared/templates/AUTHORING-RULES.md` before writing anything — it is the single source of truth.

Key constraints enforced by `scripts/validate_skills.py` and the pre-commit hook:
- Every reference `.md` requires a complete frontmatter block (`title`, `product_family`, `capabilities`, `doc_type`, `status` are mandatory)
- `product_family` must match the file's directory path
- Curated anchors must have a `## Scope` section with explicit Covers/Does NOT cover statements
- No UI navigation steps — write field tables and decision rules instead
- Cross-references use repo-relative paths only
- Plugin files (`plugins/<plugin>/`) must not reference `/shared/`
- `SKILL.md` ≤ 120 lines; every new skill PR must include passing Layer 1 eval results
